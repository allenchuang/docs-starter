## What is Portfolio Rebalancing?

A Smart Portfolio Rebalancer automatically maintains your desired asset allocation by buying assets that have fallen below their target percentage and selling assets that have risen above it. This strategy captures profits from volatility while maintaining your risk profile.

## How It Works

The rebalancer monitors your portfolio continuously and triggers trades when allocations drift beyond your set thresholds.

<Info>
  **Example**: You want 60% ETH, 40% USDC. ETH pumps and your portfolio becomes
  70% ETH, 30% USDC. The bot sells ETH and buys USDC to restore the 60/40
  balance.

## Configuration Options

### Asset Allocation

Define your target portfolio composition:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="chart-pie" title="Conservative Portfolios">
**Low-risk, stable allocations:**

- **60% ETH, 30% BTC, 10% USDC**: Balanced crypto exposure with stablecoin buffer
- **40% ETH, 40% BTC, 20% USDC**: Equal major crypto weights with larger stable allocation
- **50% ETH, 25% BTC, 25% SOL**: Diversified across top layer-1 platforms

</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="zap" title="Aggressive Portfolios">
**Higher-risk, growth-focused allocations:**

- **50% ETH, 30% SOL, 20% ARB**: Focus on layer-1 and layer-2 growth
- **40% ETH, 30% BTC, 30% Altcoins**: Broader crypto diversification
- **60% DeFi Tokens, 40% ETH**: Concentrated DeFi exposure

</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="balance-scale" title="Custom Allocations">
**Create your own portfolio:**

Set any combination of supported assets with allocations totaling 100%. Minimum allocation per asset: 5%.

Supported assets: ETH, BTC, SOL, ARB, MATIC, AVAX, USDC, USDT, and more.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Rebalancing Parameters

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="percent" title="Drift Thresholds">
Control when rebalancing occurs:

- **Conservative**: 2-3% drift (more frequent rebalancing)
- **Moderate**: 5-7% drift (balanced approach)
- **Aggressive**: 10-15% drift (less frequent, larger rebalances)

**Example**: 5% threshold with 60% ETH target triggers rebalancing when ETH allocation reaches 55% or 65%.

</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="clock" title="Time Constraints">
Manage rebalancing frequency:

- **Minimum interval**: 1-24 hours between rebalances
- **Maximum interval**: Force rebalancing after X days regardless of drift
- **Trading hours**: Restrict trading to specific time windows
- **Blackout periods**: Pause during major events or low liquidity

</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="dollar-sign" title="Trade Sizing">
Control individual trade parameters:

- **Minimum trade size**: $10-100 minimum per rebalancing trade
- **Maximum trade size**: Cap individual trades for large portfolios
- **Slippage tolerance**: 0.1-2% maximum acceptable slippage
- **Fee optimization**: Minimize transaction costs through smart routing

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

- **Maximum drawdown limits**: Pause rebalancing during severe losses
- **Correlation monitoring**: Alert when assets become highly correlated
- **Liquidity checks**: Ensure sufficient market depth before trading

## Setting Up Your Rebalancer

### Step 1: Define Your Portfolio

1. Navigate to **Strategies → Portfolio Rebalancer**
2. Click **"Create New Rebalancer"**
3. Select your desired assets from supported list
4. Set target allocations (must total 100%)

```javascript
Example Configuration:
├── ETH: 50%
├── BTC: 30%
├── SOL: 15%
└── USDC: 5%
```

### Step 2: Configure Parameters

- **Portfolio Name**: "Conservative Crypto Portfolio"
- **Total Portfolio Value**: $10,000
- **Drift Threshold**: 5%
- **Minimum Trade Size**: $25

</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="clock" title="Timing Settings">
  - **Check Frequency**: Every 4 hours - **Minimum Rebalancing Interval**: 12
  hours - **Trading Hours**: 24/7 (or set specific hours) - **Weekend Trading**:
  Enabled

### Step 3: Backtesting & Validation

Before deploying, backtest your strategy:

1. **Select backtest period**: 3-12 months of historical data
2. **Review performance metrics**: Returns, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown
3. **Analyze trade frequency**: Ensure reasonable transaction costs
4. **Compare to buy-and-hold**: Validate rebalancing adds value

<Tip>
  A good rebalancing strategy should outperform buy-and-hold on a risk-adjusted
  basis while reducing volatility.

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

<Warning>
**Avoid These Mistakes:**

- **Over-rebalancing**: Too frequent trades can erode returns through fees

- **Static allocations**: Consider periodic review and adjustment of targets

</Warning>

### Troubleshooting Issues
