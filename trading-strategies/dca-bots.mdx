## What is Dollar-Cost Averaging?

Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you buy a fixed dollar amount of an asset at regular intervals, regardless of its price. This approach reduces the impact of volatility by spreading purchases over time.

## How DCA Works

Instead of trying to time the market, DCA bots make consistent purchases that naturally buy more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high.

<Info>
**Example**: Buying $100 of ETH every week:
- Week 1: ETH at $2,000 → Buy 0.05 ETH
- Week 2: ETH at $1,600 → Buy 0.0625 ETH  
- Week 3: ETH at $2,400 → Buy 0.042 ETH

Average cost: ~$1,950 despite prices ranging from $1,600 to $2,400

└── Duration: 1 year or until budget exhausted
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="shield" title="Risk Management">
  - **Maximum single purchase**: $150 (50% above normal) - **Price deviation
  limit**: 10% (skip if price moved dramatically) - **Slippage tolerance**: 0.5%
  - **Emergency stop**: Pause on 15% daily portfolio loss - **Minimum balance**:

2. **Review metrics**: Total return, average cost, max drawdown
3. **Compare strategies**: DCA vs lump-sum vs alternative intervals
4. **Optimize parameters**: Adjust frequency and amounts based on results

<Tip>
  DCA typically outperforms lump-sum investing in volatile markets but may
  underperform in strong bull markets.

## Multi-Asset DCA Strategies

### Portfolio DCA

Apply DCA across multiple assets simultaneously:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Diversified DCA" icon="chart-pie">
**Balanced approach:**

</Card>

</CardGroup>

### Conditional Multi-Asset DCA

Adjust asset allocation based on market conditions:

- **Relative strength**: More DCA into outperforming assets

## Common Mistakes & Solutions

<Warning>
**Avoid These DCA Pitfalls:**

- **Stopping during downturns**: DCA works best when continued through volatility
