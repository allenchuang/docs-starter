## What is the Trading Wizard?

The Trading Wizard is Nimbus's AI-powered assistant that analyzes your trading goals, risk tolerance, market outlook, and capital to recommend optimal trading strategies. It provides personalized bot configurations, risk management settings, and ongoing strategy optimization.

## How the Trading Wizard Works

Our LLM-powered system combines market analysis, strategy optimization, and personalized recommendations to create tailored trading solutions.

<Info>
**Example Interaction**:
**You**: "I want to accumulate ETH over 6 months with $10,000, but I'm worried about high volatility"

**Wizard**: "Based on your goals, I recommend a hybrid approach: 60% Conservative DCA ($150/week) + 40% Signal-Enhanced Grid Trading during dips. This provides steady accumulation with opportunity for better average prices. Risk level: Low-Medium."

## Advanced Wizard Features

### Conversational Strategy Building

Engage in natural conversation to refine your strategy:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="comments" title="Interactive Dialogue">
**Natural language strategy discussion:**

**Examples of Wizard interactions:**

**You**: "I'm nervous about a potential market crash. How can I protect my portfolio?"

**Wizard**: "I recommend adding stop-loss conditions to your existing strategies and implementing a 'cash cushion' rebalancer that increases USDC allocation when volatility spikes above 80%. Would you like me to configure this?"

**You**: "My DCA bot is buying too often during small dips. Can we optimize this?"

**Wizard**: "I can add a volatility filter that only triggers DCA purchases when price drops exceed 5% from recent highs. This should reduce frequency while maintaining your accumulation goals."

</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="Strategy Education">
**Learning as you configure:**
- Explains why specific settings are recommended
- Educates about risk-return tradeoffs
- Provides historical context for strategy performance

   - Existing Strategy Optimization
   - Portfolio Review & Rebalancing
   - Market Condition Adaptation

### Sample Wizard Conversations

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="user-graduate" title="Beginner Consultation">
**New Trader Guidance:**

**Wizard**: "Welcome! I see you're new to automated trading. Let's start with your goals. Are you looking to accumulate specific cryptocurrencies, generate regular income, or explore trading for profits?"

**User**: "I want to slowly build a position in ETH and BTC over the next year with about $500 per month."

**Wizard**: "Perfect for DCA strategy! Based on your timeline and budget, I recommend: 60% ETH DCA ($300/month) + 40% BTC DCA ($200/month) with weekly purchases. I'll add protective filters to skip purchases during extreme volatility. This gives you steady accumulation with downside protection."

</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Strategy Optimization">
**Improving Existing Strategy:**

**User**: "My grid bot has been stuck in a range for 2 weeks. The market keeps trending up but my grid isn't capturing the move."

**Wizard**: "I see the issue. Your grid range ($1,800-$2,200) is below current ETH price ($2,350). I recommend: 1) Close current grid and realize profits, 2) Deploy a new grid from $2,200-$2,600, or 3) Add a trailing feature to your existing grid. Which approach fits your risk preference?"

**User**: "I like option 3. How does trailing work?"

**Wizard**: "I'll modify your grid to 'trail' upward when price stays above the upper bound for 24 hours. The entire grid shifts up by 50% of the breakout amount, maintaining your profit capture while following the trend."

</Accordion>
