## Core Technical Indicators

### Momentum Indicators

Track the strength and persistence of price movements:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="chart-line-up" title="Liquidity-Weighted RSI">
**RSI enhanced with orderbook depth:**

Traditional RSI measures overbought/oversold conditions based on price movements. Our enhanced version weighs these calculations by available liquidity at each price level.

```javascript
Enhanced RSI Calculation:
├── Traditional RSI: 73 (Overbought)
├── Liquidity Weight Factor: 0.65 (Thin orderbook above)
├── Enhanced RSI: 81 (More overbought than traditional)
├── Signal Strength: 87%
└── Recommendation: Strong sell signal
```

**Key Features**:

- More sensitive to actual market conditions
- Accounts for liquidity availability
- Reduces false signals during low-liquidity periods
- Provides confidence scores for each reading

</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="zap" title="Momentum with Order Flow">
**Momentum confirmed by order flow direction:**

Combines traditional momentum calculations with real-time order flow analysis to distinguish between genuine momentum and price manipulation.

**Signal Components**:

- **Volume momentum**: Acceleration in trading volumes
- **Order flow momentum**: Direction of aggressive orders
- **Liquidity momentum**: Changes in orderbook depth distribution

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>
