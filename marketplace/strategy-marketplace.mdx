## What is the Strategy Marketplace?

The Nimbus Strategy Marketplace is a community-driven platform where traders can discover proven strategies, share their own successful bots, and monetize their trading expertise. It creates a collaborative ecosystem where knowledge and profits are shared among community members.

## How the Marketplace Works

The marketplace connects strategy creators with users looking for profitable automated trading solutions:

<Info>
  **Example Flow**: 1. **Creator** develops and tests a profitable grid trading
  strategy 2. **Creator** publishes strategy to marketplace with performance
  history 3. **Users** discover strategy, review backtests and live performance
  4. **Users** subscribe and deploy strategy with their capital 5. **Creator**
  earns revenue share from subscriber profits 6. **Community** benefits from
  shared knowledge and improved strategies
