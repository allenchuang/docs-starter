## Technical Analysis Fundamentals

### Price Action Analysis

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Support and Resistance">
    Identify key price levels where buying and selling pressure concentrates -
    **Horizontal Levels**: Previous highs and lows that act as barriers -
    **Dynamic Levels**: Moving averages and trendlines - **Psychological
    Levels**: Round numbers (e.g., $50,000 for BTC) - **Volume-Weighted
    Levels**: Price levels with significant trading volume

</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Trend Analysis">
  Determine the overall direction of market movement - **Uptrend**: Higher highs
  and higher lows - **Downtrend**: Lower highs and lower lows -
  **Sideways/Range**: Price oscillates between support and resistance - **Trend
  Strength**: Rate of change and consistency of direction

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Chart Patterns">
    Recognize recurring patterns that suggest future price direction ```mermaid

    Patterns] B --> B1[Triangles] B --> B2[Flags] B --> B3[Pennants] B -->
    B4[Rectangles] C --> C1[Head & Shoulders] C --> C2[Double Top/Bottom] C -->
    C3[Cup & Handle] C --> C4[Wedges] ```

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Technical Indicators

<Info>
  Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on price and volume
  data that help identify trends and momentum.

</Info>

#### Trend-Following Indicators

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Moving Averages">
    Smooth price data to identify trend direction - **Simple Moving Average
    (SMA)**: Equal weight to all periods - **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**:
    More weight to recent prices - **Weighted Moving Average (WMA)**: Linear
    weighting scheme - **Hull Moving Average (HMA)**: Reduced lag smoothing
    **Common Strategies:** - MA crossovers (fast MA crosses slow MA) - Price vs
    MA (price above/below moving average) - Multiple MA system (50, 100, 200
    period MAs)

</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)">
  Momentum oscillator showing relationship between two moving averages ``` MACD
  Line = 12-period EMA - 26-period EMA Signal Line = 9-period EMA of MACD Line
  Histogram = MACD Line - Signal Line ``` **Signals:** - MACD line crosses
  above/below signal line - MACD line crosses above/below zero line - Divergence
  between MACD and price

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="ADX (Average Directional Index)">
    Measures trend strength regardless of direction - **ADX Values**: 0-100
    scale - **Weak Trend**: ADX below 25 - **Strong Trend**: ADX above 50 -
    **Very Strong Trend**: ADX above 75 **Usage:** Filter trades to only take
    signals during strong trends

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

#### Oscillators and Momentum Indicators

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="RSI (Relative Strength Index)">
    Momentum oscillator measuring speed and change of price movements
    ```
    RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
    RS = Average Gain / Average Loss
    ```
    
    **Interpretation:**
    - **Overbought**: RSI > 70
    - **Oversold**: RSI < 30
    - **Bullish Divergence**: Price makes lower low, RSI makes higher low
    - **Bearish Divergence**: Price makes higher high, RSI makes lower high

</Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Stochastic Oscillator">
    Compares closing price to price range over time period
    ```
    %K = 100 × (Close - Lowest Low) / (Highest High - Lowest Low)
    %D = 3-period moving average of %K
    ```
    
    **Signals:**
    - %K crosses above/below %D
    - Values above 80 (overbought) or below 20 (oversold)
    - Divergence with price action

</Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Williams %R">
    Momentum indicator showing relationship of close to high-low range
    - **Range**: -100 to 0
    - **Overbought**: Above -20
    - **Oversold**: Below -80
    - **Similar to Stochastic**: But unbounded and faster

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

#### Volume-Based Indicators

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)">
    Average price weighted by volume
    ```
    VWAP = Σ(Price × Volume) / Σ(Volume)
    ```
    
    **Usage:**
    - **Institutional Reference**: Large traders use VWAP as benchmark
    - **Support/Resistance**: Price often respects VWAP levels
    - **Trend Confirmation**: Price above VWAP suggests bullish sentiment

</Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="On-Balance Volume (OBV)">
    Cumulative indicator using volume to predict price changes
    ```
    If Close > Previous Close: OBV = Previous OBV + Volume
    If Close < Previous Close: OBV = Previous OBV - Volume
    If Close = Previous Close: OBV = Previous OBV
    ```
    
    **Signals:**
    - OBV trend confirmation with price trend
    - Divergence between OBV and price
    - OBV breakouts preceding price breakouts

</Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Volume Profile">
    Shows volume traded at different price levels
    - **Value Area**: 70% of volume traded within price range
    - **Point of Control (POC)**: Price level with highest volume
    - **High Volume Nodes**: Significant support/resistance levels
    - **Low Volume Nodes**: Areas of potential quick price movement
