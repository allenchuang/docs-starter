## Introduction to Risk Management

Risk management is the cornerstone of successful automated trading. While generating profits is important, preserving capital and managing downside risk is what separates successful traders from those who blow up their accounts. This guide outlines proven risk management practices for automated trading systems.

## Fundamental Risk Management Principles

### The 1% Rule

<Warning>
  Never risk more than 1-2% of your total capital on any single trade or
  strategy.

</Warning>

The foundation of risk management is limiting your maximum loss per trade:

- **Individual Trade Risk**: Maximum 1-2% of total portfolio value
- **Strategy Risk**: Maximum 5-10% of total portfolio per strategy
- **Daily Risk Limit**: Maximum 3-5% portfolio loss in a single day
- **Monthly Risk Limit**: Maximum 10-15% portfolio loss in a month

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Calculating Position Size">
    ``` Position Size = (Account Balance × Risk %) / Stop Loss Distance Example:
    - Account Balance: $100,000 - Risk per Trade: 1% = $1,000 - Stop Loss: 2%
    from entry - Position Size: $1,000 / 0.02 = $50,000 maximum position ```

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Risk-Adjusted Returns">
    Focus on risk-adjusted performance metrics: - **Sharpe Ratio**: (Return -
    Risk-free Rate) / Standard Deviation - **Sortino Ratio**: Return / Downside
    Deviation - **Calmar Ratio**: Annual Return / Maximum Drawdown -
    **Information Ratio**: Excess Return / Tracking Error

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Diversification Strategies

    A --> E[Market Condition Diversification]

    D --> D3[Long Term]

    E --> E1[Bull Markets]
    E --> E2[Bear Markets]
    E --> E3[Sideways Markets]
```

<Info>
  Effective diversification reduces portfolio volatility without necessarily
  reducing expected returns.

</Info>

## Position Sizing Methodologies

### Kelly Criterion

The Kelly Criterion provides mathematically optimal position sizing:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Kelly Formula">
    ``` Kelly % = (Win Rate × Average Win) - (Loss Rate × Average Loss) /
    Average Win Example: - Win Rate: 60% (0.6) - Average Win: 4% - Loss Rate:
    40% (0.4) - Average Loss: 2% - Kelly % = (0.6 × 4%) - (0.4 × 2%) / 4% = 1.8%
    ```

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fractional Kelly">
    Most traders use a fraction of Kelly to reduce volatility: - **Quarter Kelly
    (25%)**: Conservative approach - **Half Kelly (50%)**: Balanced approach -
    **Full Kelly (100%)**: Aggressive approach
    <Tip>
      Quarter to Half Kelly typically provides the best risk-adjusted returns
      for most traders.
    
</Tip>

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Fixed Percentage Method

Simple but effective position sizing approach:

<CheckList>
  - [ ] **Fixed Risk per Trade**: Always risk same percentage (e.g., 1%) - [ ]
  **Easy to Calculate**: Simple position sizing formula - [ ] **Consistent
  Risk**: Equal risk across all trades - [ ] **Capital Preservation**: Automatic
  position scaling as account grows/shrinks

</CheckList>

### Volatility-Based Sizing

Adjust position sizes based on market volatility:

```json
{
  "volatility_sizing": {
    "base_position_size": 0.02,
    "volatility_lookback": 20,
    "volatility_multiplier": {
      "low_vol": 1.5,
      "normal_vol": 1.0,
      "high_vol": 0.5
    },
    "max_position_size": 0.05,
    "min_position_size": 0.005
  }
}
```

## Stop-Loss Strategies

### Types of Stop-Losses

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fixed Percentage Stops">
    Simple percentage-based exit levels - **Advantages**: Easy to implement,
    consistent risk - **Disadvantages**: Doesn't account for market volatility -
    **Best For**: Stable, low-volatility markets - **Example**: Always exit at
    -2% loss regardless of conditions

</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Volatility-Based Stops">
  ATR (Average True Range) based stop placement - **Advantages**: Adapts to
  market conditions - **Disadvantages**: More complex to calculate - **Best
  For**: Varying volatility environments - **Example**: Stop = Entry Price - (2
  × ATR)

</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Technical Stops">
  Stops based on technical levels - **Support/Resistance Levels**: Stop below
  support for longs - **Moving Average Stops**: Exit when price crosses MA -
  **Fibonacci Levels**: Stops at key retracement levels - **Chart Pattern
  Stops**: Based on pattern invalidation points

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Time-Based Stops">
    Exit positions after predetermined time periods - **Maximum Hold Time**:
    Exit after X days regardless of P&L - **Weekend Exits**: Close positions
    before market close - **Session-Based**: Exit at end of trading sessions -
    **Decay Stops**: Tighten stops as time passes

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Dynamic Stop Management

<Warning>
  Never move stops against your position - this violates fundamental risk
  management principles.

</Warning>

Advanced stop-loss techniques:

- **Trailing Stops**: Move stops in your favor as profits increase
- **Breakeven Stops**: Move stop to entry price after predetermined profit
- **Profit Scaling**: Take partial profits and trail remainder
- **Volatility Adjustment**: Adjust stop distance based on changing volatility

## Portfolio-Level Risk Management

### Correlation Management

Monitor and control correlation between positions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Correlation Monitoring">
    Track correlation between:
    - Individual positions in portfolio
    - Different strategies running simultaneously
    - Portfolio vs overall market (Beta)
    - Cross-asset correlations during stress periods

</Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Correlation Limits">
    Set maximum correlation thresholds:
    ```json
    {
      "correlation_limits": {
        "max_position_correlation": 0.7,
        "max_strategy_correlation": 0.5,
        "portfolio_concentration": {
          "max_single_asset": 0.20,
          "max_sector_exposure": 0.30,
          "max_geography": 0.40
        }
      }
    }
    ```

</Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Correlation-Based Position Sizing">
    Reduce position sizes when correlations increase:
    - **Low Correlation (< 0.3)**: Full position sizing
    - **Medium Correlation (0.3-0.7)**: Reduce positions by 25-50%
    - **High Correlation (> 0.7)**: Reduce positions by 50-75%
    - **Crisis Correlation (> 0.9)**: Consider position closure

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Maximum Drawdown Controls

<Info>
  Drawdown protection is often more important than maximizing returns for
  long-term success.

</Info>

Implement systematic drawdown controls:

<CheckList>
  - [ ] **Portfolio Maximum Drawdown**: 15-20% maximum portfolio decline - [ ]
  **Strategy Drawdown Limits**: 10-15% maximum per strategy - [ ] **Daily Loss
  Limits**: 3-5% maximum daily portfolio loss - [ ] **Risk Scaling**: Reduce
  position sizes during drawdowns - [ ] **Circuit Breakers**: Halt trading
  during extreme conditions

</CheckList>
