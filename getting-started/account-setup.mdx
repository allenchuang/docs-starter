## Step 4: Security Best Practices

### API Key Security

<Warning>
  **Critical Security Rules:** - Never enable withdrawal permissions - Use
  unique API keys only for Nimbus - Regularly rotate your API keys
  (monthly) - Monitor your account for unexpected activity

</Warning>

### Account Protection

- Enable 2FA on your Hyperliquid account
- Use a dedicated trading wallet
- Set position size limits
- Enable email notifications for trades

### IP Whitelisting

For maximum security, restrict API key access:

1. In Hyperliquid API settings, add Nimbus's IP addresses:
   - `52.91.45.123` (Primary)
   - `3.87.156.201` (Backup)
2. This prevents unauthorized access from other locations
