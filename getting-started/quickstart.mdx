Launch your first automated trading bot on Hyperliquid quickly and safely.

### Step 1: Connect Your Hyperliquid Account

    allocation percentages across multiple assets Both strategies are low-risk
    and perfect for learning how Hyperscript works.

    Configure your bot with conservative settings: **For DCA Bot:** - Investment
    amount: Start with $10-50 per purchase - Frequency: Daily or weekly
    intervals - Asset: Choose a major asset like ETH or BTC **For Portfolio
    Rebalancer:** - Allocation: 60% ETH, 40% USDC (example) - Rebalance
    threshold: 5-10% - Total portfolio size: Start small ($100-500)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
