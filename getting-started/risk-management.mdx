## Risk Management Fundamentals

Successful automated trading starts with proper risk management. This guide covers essential concepts and tools to protect your capital.

## Core Risk Management Principles

### Position Sizing

Never risk more than you can afford to lose on any single trade or strategy.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Conservative Approach" icon="shield">
**Recommended for beginners:**
- 1-2% of portfolio per trade
- 5-10% maximum allocation per strategy
- Diversify across multiple assets

</Card>

<Card title="Aggressive Approach" icon="zap">
**For experienced traders:**
- 3-5% of portfolio per trade
- 15-25% maximum per strategy
- Higher leverage tolerance

</Card>

</CardGroup>

### The 1% Rule

<Info>
**Golden Rule**: Never risk more than 1% of your total portfolio on a single trade.

**Example**: $10,000 portfolio = maximum $100 risk per trade

</AccordionGroup>

## Risk Assessment Tools

### Portfolio Risk Score

Nimbus calculates a real-time risk score based on:

- Current position sizes
- Asset correlations
- Market volatility
- Strategy performance

<div style="background: linear-gradient(to right, #22c55e, #eab308, #ef4444); height: 20px; border-radius: 10px; position: relative;">
  <div style="position: absolute; top: -30px; left: 0; color: #22c55e;">
    Low Risk
  
</div>
  <div style="position: absolute; top: -30px; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%); color: #eab308;">
    Medium Risk
  
</div>
  <div style="position: absolute; top: -30px; right: 0; color: #ef4444;">
    High Risk
  
</div>

</div>

### Correlation Matrix

Monitor how your assets move together:

| Asset   | ETH | BTC | SOL | ARB |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ETH** | 1.0 | 0.8 | 0.9 | 0.7 |
| **BTC** | 0.8 | 1.0 | 0.7 | 0.6 |
| **SOL** | 0.9 | 0.7 | 1.0 | 0.8 |
| **ARB** | 0.7 | 0.6 | 0.8 | 1.0 |

<Warning>
  High correlation (>0.8) between assets increases portfolio risk. Diversify
  into uncorrelated assets when possible.

</Warning>

## Setting Up Risk Controls

### Step 1: Portfolio Configuration

Navigate to **Settings → Risk Management** and configure:

```javascript
Portfolio Settings:
├── Maximum Daily Loss: $100 (1% of $10k portfolio)
├── Maximum Position Size: $500 (5% allocation)
├── Correlation Limit: 0.8 (maximum between assets)
└── Emergency Stop: Enabled (pause all bots on 5% daily loss)
```

### Step 2: Individual Bot Limits

For each trading bot, set:

<CheckList>
  - Maximum position size (dollars or percentage) - Stop-loss percentage
  (recommended: 2-5%) - Take-profit target (recommended: 4-10%) - Maximum
  consecutive losses (recommended: 3-5)

</CheckList>

### Step 3: Market Condition Filters

Enable automatic trading pauses during:

- **High volatility periods** (>50% daily price swings)
- **Low liquidity conditions** (thin orderbooks)
- **Major news events** (based on calendar integration)
- **Weekend trading** (optional, lower liquidity)

## Advanced Risk Management

### Dynamic Position Sizing

Automatically adjust position sizes based on:

- **Recent performance**: Reduce size after losses
- **Market volatility**: Smaller positions in volatile conditions
- **Strategy confidence**: Larger positions for high-probability setups

### Kelly Criterion Implementation

Optimize position sizing using the Kelly Criterion:

```
Position Size = (Win Rate × Average Win - Loss Rate × Average Loss) / Average Win
```

Example: 60% win rate, $10 average win, $5 average loss

```
Position Size = (0.6 × 10 - 0.4 × 5) / 10 = 0.4 or 40% of available capital
```

<Warning>
  Kelly Criterion can suggest aggressive position sizes. Consider using 25-50%
  of the calculated amount for safety.

</Warning>

## Emergency Procedures

### Circuit Breakers

Nimbus includes automatic circuit breakers:

1. **5% daily loss**: Pause all bots for 1 hour
2. **10% daily loss**: Pause all bots until manual review
3. **Market crash detection**: Pause during >20% market drops

### Manual Override

Always maintain the ability to:

- **Emergency stop**: Instantly pause all trading activity
- **Close all positions**: Market orders to exit everything
- **Withdraw funds**: Move assets to cold storage if needed
